# Images Directory

Place your presentation images here.

## Organization Tips

- Use descriptive filenames: `detector-diagram.png`, `results-plot.png`
- Organize by slide topic if needed (create subdirectories)
- Optimize images before adding (compress large files)
- Prefer PNG for diagrams, JPG for photos

## Symlinks

You can symlink images from other presentations or shared assets:

```bash
# Link specific image
ln -s ../../../shared-assets/logos/ku_logo.png ./ku_logo.png

# Link from another presentation
ln -s "../../Geneva presentation/public/images/detector.jpg" ./detector.jpg
```

Symlinked images work exactly like regular files in your slides.
